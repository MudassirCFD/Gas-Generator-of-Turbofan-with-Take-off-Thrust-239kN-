## Project Overview
This thesis presents the design and analysis of a three shaft turbofan engine gas generator for heavy cargo aircraft. The work includes thermodynamic calculations, compressor blade profiling, structural verification, and manufacturing process planning.

## Main Specifications
- **Take off thrust:** 239 kN
- **Bypass ratio:** 5.60
- **Compressor pressure ratio:** 26.2
- **Turbine inlet temperature:** 1,615 K
- **Prototype engine:** D-18T (230 kN thrust)

## Thesis Structure
1. **Theoretical Part:** Thermo gas dynamic calculations, compressor and turbine matching
2. **Design Part:** Strength analysis of blades, discs, and blade locks; vibration analysis
3. **Technological Part:** Cutting condition calculations for turning, drilling, and milling operations

## Key Results
- Specific thrust: 312.38 N·s/kg (improved from prototype 300.65 N·s/kg)
- Specific fuel consumption: 0.037686 kg/(N·h)
- Compressor efficiencies: 88.5% to 90.4%
- Blade natural frequency: 338.65 Hz (resonance free in operational range)
- All safety factors exceed aviation standards
